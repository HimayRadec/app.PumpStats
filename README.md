## Getting Started
This is a template with user email/password login to a MongoDB Database setup.
Your .env.local file must contain the following tokens
MONGODB_URI = Database URI String
MONGO_PASSWORD = User Database Password
NEXTAUTH_URL = The URL the project will be accessed through when running (in development it is usually `http://localhost:3000`)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET = Used to encrypt the NextAuth.js JWT, and to hash email verification tokens. This is the default value for the secret option in NextAuth and Middleware.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
